  <title>Folkswagen Bug Origins</title>
    <body>
      <p>The Folkswagen Bug is an ugly car. It's the worst car produced in our country and possible
      also the entire world. If I found an uglier car I would not write this long paragraph. The bug
      was invented somewhere in our country and it was not a hit even there. It was later adopted by
      the market but was not a huge hit. There were various iterations of the car, each was not very
      successful as the company really did not have enough style.</p>
    <p>The company later attempted to produce a truck which had a defective tailgate. The drivetrain
      did not properly work most of the times. The vehicle frame was frail and predisposed to
      falling apart at high speeds.</p>
    <p>The Folkswagen motor-bike was also a big failure with an underdeveloped motor.</p>
