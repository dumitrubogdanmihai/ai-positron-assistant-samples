    <draft-summary>We have a new action "Format and Indent..." in the contextual menu of the project
      explorer. The dialog displayed by the action is very similar to the one displayed by "Spell
      Check in Files...", so it will probably be helpful to check out the documentation for the
      spell check action. The only difference is that the Spell Check options button is missing in
      my dialog, and I added a an option for creating (or not) backup files. The action is available
      on both the SA and the Eclipse plug-in, on all distributions (editor, developer, author). One
      important note is that the XQuery pretty printer is not available on oXygen Author, therefore
      the batch action will ignore XQuery files on this distribution.</draft-summary>
